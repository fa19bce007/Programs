# Programs
In this repository you will find basic practice questions for many high level languages like C++,C, Python, MATLAB etc. which will help you guys to practice and understand code well. You can find Question of the each program in the readme file in that folder. I will try to create a separate folder for each question with source file/solution code and a question file (readme) and will try to rename them in such a way that you can easily understand the question from the source file name. You guys can add your files related to the topic in this repository too. Feel Free to contact me in any query.THANKS
